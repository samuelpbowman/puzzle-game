A game for iOS written in Objective-C

I did this in 2017 when I was out of school because I had a Mac with XCode at my disposal and wanted to try my hand at
iOS development. I had a book (which was somewhat out of date) that dealt with Mac and iOS programming in Objective C, 
so my goal was to use what I learned reading that book to build something that I could show people. 

The game is a simple sliding puzzle, with an icon that I poached from another project as the puzzle image. I did not 
implement animations for piece movement, but the pieces do move when you swipe in a direction that is swipeable. When
a user wins, the game field turns green. The feature I am most proud of is that, when a user shakes his or her 
device, the puzzle reverts to before the most recent move was made.
